Drum Sequencer
----

Built with `create-react-app`. :smile:

### Usage

- Hit the `Play` button to begin playback.
- Clicking a note toggles it between 3 states: on, quiet (ghost note), and off.
- Change `Tempo` to adjust the tempo to your liking
- Change `Subdivision` to work with different "resolutions" of notes
