Drum Sequencer
----

Built with `create-react-app`. :smile:

### Usage

- Load up one of the preset example `Grooves` to get some inspiration
- Hit the `Play` button to begin playback.
- Clicking a note toggles it between 3 states: on, quiet (ghost note), and off.
- Change `Tempo` to adjust the tempo to your liking
- Change `Subdivision` to work with different "resolutions" of notes
- `Save` your creation to your local browser storage
- Load up `Grooves` you've saved
- `Share` a link to your creation with a friend
